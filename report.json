        "explanation": "**Explanation:**  \nThis code is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** because it directly inserts user input (`username` and `password`) into the SQL query string. An attacker can manipulate these inputs to alter the query and gain unauthorized access or damage the database.\n\n**Secure Approach (using parameterized queries):**\n\n**Python (with sqlite3):**\n```python\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?\"\ncursor.execute(query, (username, password))\n```\n\n**Why this is secure:**  \nParameterized queries ensure that user inputs are treated as data, not as part of the SQL command, preventing attackers from injecting malicious SQL code."
