# llm-secure-code-review-agent

An intelligent, automated security reviewer designed to catch vulnerabilities, enforce best practices, and assist developers in writing safer code. Powered by large language models and built for real‑world engineering workflows, this agent integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, local development environments, and security review processes.

🚀 Overview
Modern software moves fast — security reviews often don’t. This project brings the power of LLMs to static analysis, enabling:

Automated detection of security vulnerabilities

Context‑aware explanations and remediation suggestions

Multi‑language support

Integration with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket workflows

Continuous learning from project‑specific patterns

The goal is simple: make secure coding effortless and accessible without slowing down development.

✨ Key Features
🔎 Intelligent Vulnerability Detection
Identifies common issues like injection, insecure deserialization, broken auth, unsafe crypto, and more

Understands code semantics, not just patterns

Highlights risky flows across files and functions

🧠 LLM‑Driven Reasoning
Uses a large language model to reason about intent, architecture, and context

Provides human‑readable explanations

Suggests secure alternatives and best practices
